The `8x1 KVM product integration information` folder contains additional documentation that was eventually sent to me.
There is a windows executable that appears to support more functionality than the basic serial documentation.

It shouldn't be super difficult to run the program and monitor the UART with either wireshar or a logic analyzer to figure out how to do the "program exclusive" things like:

- Change the IP address
- Change the LED display timeout

I don't need this functionality for my purposes so I'm not going to bother...
